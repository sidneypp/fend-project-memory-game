## Project Purpose:

This game was built as a Udacity Course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How to Play the Game

The game board consists of sixteen cards randomly arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

On each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
